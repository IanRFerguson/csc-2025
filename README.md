# Changemakers 2025 - Engineering Source Code

## src
This module contains two scripts, `nba_to_gcs` and `gcs_to_bigquery` (these are pretty self explanatory). You can run one or the other at the command line, or run both back to back with `make pipeline` from the root directory.

## dbt
WIP

## infra
You can run this pipeline yourself in your own project - just change the project name in `main.tf`, run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`.
